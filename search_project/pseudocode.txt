Search overview
	randomly select 20 tiles
	carry out uniform cost without protein sequence
	if (cost of 2 consecutive tiles < threshold) {
		group tiles into one
		check with protein sequence to ensure correct assignment
	}
	add tiles back onto list
	loop till done

Things to change

	COMMENT ALL THE CODE (JOEL TELLING HIMSELF TO DO THIS)
	
	search_strategies.py
		develop a function to make a node containing 20 random tiles and start a search on them (needs testing)
		develop a function to check if tile cost on combined tiles are low enough and match the protein chain (needs to be made)
		Save data to file?

	search_project.py
		Good for now

	Node.py
		Good for now

	Tile.py
		Good for now

Others
	calculation of threshold
		should it be a function of number of iterations? 
		find a good value from current data
	print characteristic with output

Search overview
	randomly select 20 tiles
	carry out uniform cost without protein sequence
	if (cost of 2 consecutive tiles < threshold) {
		group tiles into one
		check with protein sequence to ensure correct assignment
	}
	add tiles back onto list
	loop till done

Things to change
	search_strategies.py
		make uniform_cost() take in a node and returns a solution not prints it
		add a initialization function that gets the data from our input file and returns a node
		make a printing function to display results (and save to a file?)
		develop a function to make a node containing 20 random tiles and start a search on them
		develop a function to check if tile cost on combined tiles are low enough and match the protein chain

	search_project.py
		adjust it to call the correct starter function
		Add another command line input to select algorithm?

	Node.py
		check to see if the characteristic==null
			if it does, do not calculate the characteristic cost in the expand function

	Tile.py
		add a tile list so we can store many tiles in a single tile
		overload the __init__ so we can pass in a tile list
		if no tile list, tile list should be set to null

Others
	calculation of threshold
		should it be a function of number of iterations? 
		find a good value from current data
	output data file?
	print characteristic with output 
	makeFile?

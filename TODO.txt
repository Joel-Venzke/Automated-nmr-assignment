give all tiles, assign 20 then restart at 20

Clean up code (remove things that are no longer used, get rid of old incomplete puzzle building implementation)

include new data in the unit test

(needs checking) *implemented but heuristic could be better* A* stuff 

More filtering (try new models, work on settings of current models) (spend some time with neural nets and see if we can beat LMT)

machine learning for cost calculation (is this possible? maybe come up with better way to calculate it, take care of missing data issues)

(needs checking) *implemented* Pro case (loop through all tiles, count pro, make special place holder tiles, check in search) 

heapq for the frontier data structure

	abstract = {Automated methods for protein structure determination by {NMR} have increasingly gained acceptance and are now widely used for the automated assignment of distance restraints and the calculation of three-dimensional structures. This review gives an overview of the techniques for automated protein structure analysis by {NMR}, including both {NOE-based} approaches and methods relying on other experimental data such as residual dipolar couplings and chemical shifts, and presents the {FLYA} algorithm for the fully automated {NMR} structure determination of proteins that is suitable to substitute all manual spectra analysis and thus overcomes a major efficiency limitation of the {NMR} method for protein structure determination.},
